It is always nice to receive feedback.
If you use *py-jelastic* please drop us line sharing your experience.
It is appreciated if you introduce yourself,
also mention how long are you using *py-jelastic* and using it for what.

A lot of *py-jelastic* features were driven by external ideas and use-cases,
so new ideas are welcome too.

Questions
---------

Question can be asked in the `discussion forum <https://github.com/Onemind-Services-LLC/py-jelastic/discussions>`_.

Issues/bugs
-----------

If you find issues using *py-jelastic* please report at
`github issues <https://github.com/Onemind-Services-LLC/py-jelastic/issues>`_.

Feature requests
----------------

Feature requests should also be raised on `github <https://github.com/Onemind-Services-LLC/py-jelastic/issues>`_,
sometimes it is a good idea to have an initial discussion of a new feature in the discussion forum.

You will be expected provide a real world / example of why and how this feature would be used (if not obvious).

Users are expected to implement new features themselves.
If you are not willing to spend your time on it, probably nobody else will...
